    "text": "i canceled my spotify subscription of 6 years. no one cares, but this is after all a rant. i feel like i am listening to the same music over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. wanna listen to 90s? here is lunch by billie eillish 🤩✨️ wanna listen to soft rock? here is lunch by billie eillish 🤩✨️ wanna listen to rap/hip hop? here is lunch by billie eillish 🤩✨️ made for you killed spotify for me. spotify makes me hate my music because it keeps on playing it over and over again, everywhere. all my playlists are just the same songs over and over again. i have over 4000 liked songs and every playlist is the same. + the algorithm feels way to advertisy. i notice that when artists are about to drop albums, suddenly i get an influx of music by that artists in my shuffles or playlists because spotify thinks i actually want to listen to my liked songs when i search for public playlists. + price hike, duh. and for those who care, a price hike with a ceo who said music costs nothing to make as a way of justifying not paying artists. i will be honest too tho. if spotify ever fixes their poop, i would come back, but until made for you dies or is optional, i am not coming back. btw, i like the lunch song, it's just overplayed on my spotify playlists, that's all. i am a billie eilish fan lol i created a post, like it if you agree with me!",

(most people who enjoy music and art are completely against ai in the arts). not to mention the smart shuffle automatically cutting on and now the most annoying bug that the app has ever had: my shuffle will play the same queue of songs everytime i start the playlist from another song. i have a playlist of 5,000 songs from 11 years worth of using spotify and i can not stand that it is queueing the same songs everytime i start from a new song (i often start it from a newer song that i've added and skip through). please fix this shuffle feature or you will lose a customer. i'm also posting this into this small group because the main spotify group is impossible to post in and i was marked as a bot in the second channel. the website community forum is also impossible to post in or to chat with anyone. spotify got too big for it's own good.",

    "text": "artist payouts on spotify vs amazon music: is the difference real, or just a question of subscription tiers? i've been looking seriously into the whole debate about artist payouts across different music streaming platforms, trying to cut through the usual noise and get to the facts. a lot of people claim amazon music pays artists better than spotify, but the reality is more nuanced. it depends entirely on the type of subscription, not just the platform itself. spotify premium, at its maximum quality (ogg 320 kbps), pays artists approximately $0.00318 per stream on average. amazon music unlimited standard, which streams in mp3 320 kbps, pays about $0.00402 per stream. so yes, amazon music unlimited pays more, but the difference is modest — roughly 25% more compared to spotify premium, for equivalent audio quality. but here's the real issue: the vast majority of amazon music users stick with the included amazon prime music tier. this plan comes with lower audio quality (256 kbps) and, more importantly, a significantly lower payout to artists, estimated at around $0.001–$0.002 per stream, which is even less than what artists earn from spotify premium streams, and comparable to payouts from ad-supported free tiers. this all comes down to the well-known revenue pool system: streams from paying subscribers (premium, unlimited, hd) contribute to a more lucrative pool for artists, while streams from free or semi-free users (prime music included, spotify free) go into a much smaller pool, meaning lower payouts for artists. in short, for the same audio quality, an amazon prime music user actually supports artists less than a spotify premium subscriber, despite the claims you often read on reddit. of course, if you step up",

    "text": "spotify annual gift card price increase to $120 in process! get $99 while there's still stock! if anyone uses spotify individual premium plan, it looks like the $99 annual giftcards you can use to save money (you save a bit over $40 paying the $11.99 a month) on a subscription are in the process of being changed to $120 annual gift cards. i recommend buying them at the $99 price now while you still can if you do this gift card trick! i was able to buy a digital one at bestbuy today for $99 and it gave me the full year credit on spotify. amazon has already switched to $120 pricing for annual. sams club canceled my digital order for the $99 today. any physical $99 annual premium spotify cards should still be that price and work for a year as well. (note that these annual gift cards can't be used on any other kind of accounts, they don't work on duo or family etc).",

    "text": "spotify switching from the 'liked song heart' to the 'in your library check' has ruined the ui for me i recently updated spotify on my mac for the first time in ages and have discovered that the newer versions of spotify use a checkmark to indicate songs in your library now instead of showing a heart next to your liked songs. for me personally, this is devestating. i'm crazy and my spotify is organized like an itunes library. i make \"playlists\" where i just put entire albums into a playlist named that album, then sort those playlists into artist folders. for example, i have every 2pac, jay-z, mariah carey, etc album in individual playlists, and then put all those albums (playlists) into individual artist discography folders. because of this, essentially any rap / r&b song you can think of is \"in my library\" in some capacity due to me having album \"playlists\" created for artists entire discographies. this makes it extremely difficult to simply click on any random playlist or album i may have only heard once and attempt to figure out which song(s) i actually liked because everything has a check next to it. i may be speaking on deaf ears, but i would love if spotify would resort back to the old heart icon to only show liked songs, or at least add the heart back in conjunction w/ the check to differentiate between the two.",

    "text": "considering switching to apple music - my thoughts so far i'm a long long time spotify premium subscriber (premium family plan for the past many years, individual before that) and am considering switching to a new platform. apple music recently introduced [a feature]( via songshift that allows importing playlists from other platforms into am. you can use songshift directly (and of course there are other options) but the tight integration made transitioning painless. so i signed up for an individual am account and am testing it before cancelling spotify. some very early thoughts: * spotify desktop apps on both windows and mac are better. some of this is probably muscle memory, but some things, especially on windows (unsurprisingly, i guess) are imo just worse. * the am mobile app is on par with spotify, in terms of polish. * there were quite a few songs that didn't transfer from my spotify playlists. i do go deep into some genres, but i *think* spotify's library is larger. * the lyrics integration in am is better. spotify introduced lyrics, then moved them lower, so it's harder to access. they are front and center in am. * spotify is \\~18% more expensive for the family plans, but of course includes a pretty decent audiobook collection. i think i'd be better off just buying the audiobooks and honestly i don't appreciate spotify forcing me to pay for audiobooks. * am is refreshingly just music. however, i will need to find a new podcast app. i've yet to find a podcast app that i liked, at least not since google discontinued its app in 2024. * i haven't messed around enough with this yet, but",

    "text": "just switched back from am—siri functionality removed? i just switched back to spotify after using apple music for about a year and a half. i rely heavily on siri when i’m driving or working, and siri used to work perfectly with spotify. previously, i could say things like: • “hey siri, play michael jackson” → siri would start playing his top-listened-to songs. • “hey siri, play some rap/blues/k-pop” → siri would start a radio station for that genre. • “hey siri, play a different station” → siri would switch to something new. starting today, siri only plays music from my playlists or my library, and it no longer starts stations or top songs. here’s what’s happening now: • if i’m listening to michael jackson and say “hey siri, play a different station,” siri just says “now playing michael jackson” and keeps playing the same track. • if i’m inside my “twice essentials” playlist and say “hey siri, play something else,” siri replies “here’s twice essentials” and continues the same song. • if i say “hey siri, play <artist>” it only plays the playlist “this is <artist>” or “ essentials <artist>” instead of starting their top tracks or a radio station. troubleshooting i’ve already tried: • apple “intelligence” on/off • clearing siri & dictation history • phone restart • reinstalling spotify is this an intentional change on apple’s side, spotify’s side, or a new siri behavior? one of the main reasons i switched back from apple music was because siri there always played the least popular songs when i’d say “siri, play .” spotify used to fix that, but now it seems broken too. is anyone else seeing this?",

    "text": "spotify not adding songs to multiple playlists bug so this has been bugging me to the point where i will probably stop using spotify if i can't find a consistent fix. in the app, when i add a singular song to multiple playlists at once, for some reason, now and again it will just decide to only add it to a fraction of the playlists i selected (i have approx 10 playlists i divided between mood and genre) and i won't be able to tell this has happened unless i go back into the song and check what playlists it has been added to. i'm currently trying to redo all my playlists and will potentially be adding thousands of songs so this will make adding songs a complete mess. for instance i was adding 2 albums to my playlists the other day. in one album only 2 of the songs got messed up but in the other album every song had only been added to some of the playlists that i had selected. to give a clear example of what is happening, say i have this song i want to add, and i want to add it to playlist 1, 2, 3 and 4. the first time i add the song it'll only go into playlist 1. if i do it again it'll go into 1,2,3 and then if i do it again it'll finally go into all 4. its a pain in the ass. please lemme know if you have had this issue and found a fix because i haven't been able to find much online about it.",

    "text": "discover weekly shows only 13–17 tracks instead of 30 (bug confirmed by spotify support, still not fixed) hi everyone, i’ve been having a weird issue with my *discover weekly* playlist for two weeks now. instead of the usual 30 tracks, it only shows **13 tracks one week** and **17 the next**, sometimes with **duplicate songs by the same artist** (for example, 3 songs from zz top and 3 from gamma ray this week). here’s a summary of what happened: * i already contacted **spotify support**, and they **escalated my case** to the **highest level of customer support**. * they confirmed they see **30 tracks on their end**, but i (and even when checking through a vpn or test browsers) can only see 13–17. * i’ve **uninstalled/reinstalled** spotify twice, **cleared cache**, **checked on different devices and connections**, and even tried the **test account** they gave me — which does show 30 tracks (but totally unrelated to my taste). * support suggested i create a **new account** and transfer all my data, but that would mean losing **7 years of listening history and algorithm progress**, which is not an acceptable “fix.” * i’ve also noticed that discover weekly refreshes at **2 am instead of midnight** now, and my **release radar** recently included **songs i’d already liked** months ago. so it seems something’s broken in my account’s recommendation system — maybe a corrupted profile or algorithm bug. has anyone else experienced the same? did creating a new account actually fix it, or is there another way to “reset” discover weekly without losing years of data? any insight or confirmation from others would be really appreciated 🙏",

    "text": "spotify for artists support is useless my artists has been dropping music for the last 3 years on spotify. over a year ago our numbers started going crazy and we were looking into claiming his spotify for artist, which we weren’t able to because someone had previously claimed it and started mocking us in the bio (strange world these days). after trying to contact spotify for artists multiple times about this issue with all the needed information that we are the ones dropping all the music under that name, they told us to contact the person which is mocking us with an offensive bio. how do you expect us to claim our profile and make it look professional for our upcoming label deal, when someone is already in there? we don’t even know the person so how am i even able to get in contact like support told us to do?",
